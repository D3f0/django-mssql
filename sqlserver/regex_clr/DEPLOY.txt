To deploy this assembly to your Database, you have a couple of options.

A) You can put in your connection string information in the regex_clr 
	project's properties. Pressing "play" (ie, running) the solution will
	then deploy the assembly to the designated server.
	
B) You can issue "CREATE ASSEMBLY" statements in a SQL console
	or build script, as described here:
	http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345099.aspx
	
In both cases you may need to enable CLR support in your database
as described here:
