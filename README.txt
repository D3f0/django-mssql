This project contains a Django database backend for Microsoft SQL Server 2005.

== TO INSTALL ==

Copy the entire "sqlserver_ado" folder from src/ to somewhere on your Python 
path, visible to both Django and the command-line tools. This could be in 
your lib/site_packages, django/db/backends (if you don't mind mixing in 
external code), or anywhere else on the Python path.
